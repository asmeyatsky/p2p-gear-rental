# Project Roadmap: P2P Gear Rental

This roadmap outlines the planned improvements and future features for the P2P Gear Rental application.

## Current State (Summary)

The application has a solid foundation with core functionalities like user management, gear listing, rental workflow, reviews, and payments already in place. The project structure is well-organized, and the use of modern technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, Supabase, and Stripe indicates a robust and scalable architecture.

## Improvements & Future Features

### 1. Search & Filtering Enhancements
*   **Improvement:** Enhance search relevance (e.g., fuzzy matching, prioritizing exact matches).
*   **Improvement:** Add more filter options (e.g., availability dates, gear type/category dropdowns).

### 2. Error Handling & User Feedback
*   **Improvement:** Implement more user-friendly error messages for all API calls and form submissions.
*   **Improvement:** Add loading states and success notifications (e.g., using a toast library).

### 3. Testing Expansion
*   **Improvement:** Expand Jest and Playwright tests to cover all critical API routes and UI components. Aim for high test coverage for core flows.

### 4. UI/UX Polish
*   **Improvement:** Refine Tailwind CSS styling for a modern, clean, and consistent look across all pages. Focus on responsiveness.
*   **Improvement:** Improve navigation (e.g., clear header links, user dropdown for profile/settings).
*   **Improvement:** Design empty states for lists (e.g., "No gear found," "No rental requests").
*   **Improvement:** Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for gear listings.

### 5. Deployment & Performance Optimization
*   **Improvement:** Deploy the application to a production-ready hosting environment.
*   **Improvement:** Optimize image loading and implement server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) where appropriate.

### 6. Advanced Features (Future Considerations)
*   **Advanced Search & Filters:** Map view for location-based search.
*   **User Dashboards:** More comprehensive dashboards for renters and owners.
*   **Dispute Resolution System:** A mechanism to handle disagreements.
*   **Insurance/Guarantees:** Explore options for protecting gear and users.
*   **Push Notifications/Email Notifications:** For critical updates.
*   **Admin Panel:** For managing users, listings, and disputes.
