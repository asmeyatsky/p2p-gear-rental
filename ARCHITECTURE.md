# P2P Gear Rental Platform - Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This application follows a Clean/Hexagonal Architecture pattern with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, implementing separation of concerns, high cohesion, and low coupling.

## Architectural Layers

### 1. Domain Layer (Core Business Logic)
- **Entities**: Business objects with identity and lifecycle (Gear, User, Rental)
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects defined by their attributes
- **Domain Services**: Contains domain logic that doesn't naturally fit within entities
- **Domain Events**: Used to communicate between aggregates
- **Repository Ports**: Interfaces defining data access contracts (abstractions)

### 2. Application Layer (Orchestration)
- **Use Cases**: Encapsulate specific business processes
- **DTOs**: Data transfer objects for communication between layers
- **Application Services**: Coordinate between domain and infrastructure

### 3. Infrastructure Layer (External Dependencies)
- **Repositories**: Implement repository ports with database access
- **Adapters**: Implement external service ports (Payment, Notification, etc.)
- **Configuration**: Dependency injection container
- **Framework-specific code**: Prisma client, etc.

### 4. Presentation Layer (User Interface)
- **API Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **UI Components**: React components consuming domain logic
- **View Models**: Data models tailored for UI consumption

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Immutability**: Domain entities are designed to be immutable where possible
2. **Interface-First**: All external dependencies are defined through interfaces
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Higher-level modules don't depend on lower-level modules directly
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a single responsibility
5. **Testability**: Architecture supports unit testing with mocked dependencies

## Implementation Patterns

### Domain Entities
- Immutable by design (state changes create new instances)
- Encapsulate business rules and invariants
- Contain validation logic
- Follow rich domain model principles

### Use Cases
- One use case per class
- Orchestrates between domain services and repositories
- Contains application-specific business logic
- Follows CQS (Command Query Separation) principles

### Ports and Adapters
- Domain layer defines interfaces
- Infrastructure layer implements interfaces
- Enables switching between implementations (e.g., different databases)
- Supports testing with mock implementations

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to understand and modify
2. **Testability**: Layers can be tested independently with mocked dependencies
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to switch implementations or add new ones
4. **Scalability**: Components can be developed and deployed independently
5. **Business Focus**: Domain layer reflects the business domain accurately

## Anti-Patterns Avoided

1. Anemic Domain Models: Domain objects contain business logic
2. Service Layer Bloat: Logic is distributed across appropriate layers
3. Infrastructure Leak: Domain doesn't depend on specific frameworks
4. Mixed Concerns: Each layer has clear responsibilities
5. Tight Coupling: Dependencies are managed through interfaces

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Domain entities and services
- **Integration Tests**: Repository implementations
- **Use Case Tests**: Business logic orchestration
- **Component Tests**: UI components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user journeys
