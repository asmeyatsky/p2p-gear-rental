# Path to Deployment

Now that the Docker container is building successfully, you can move on to the next phases of the project, which include local verification, making improvements, and eventually deploying to a production environment.

## 1. Local Verification

Before making any changes, it's a good idea to run the application and the tests to ensure everything is working as expected.

*   **Run the application locally:**
    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```
    Then open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

*   **Run tests:**
    *   Unit & Integration Tests (Jest): `npm test`
    *   End-to-End Tests (Playwright): `npm run test:e2e`

## 2. Future Improvements (from `GEMINI.md`)

The core functionality is complete, but there are several areas for improvement:

*   **Search & Filtering:** Enhance search relevance and add more filter options.
*   **Error Handling & User Feedback:** Implement more user-friendly error messages, loading states, and success notifications.
*   **Testing:** Expand test coverage for API routes and UI components.
*   **UI/UX Polish:** Refine the styling, improve navigation, and design empty states for lists.
*   **Deployment & Performance:** Deploy to a production environment and optimize performance.

## 3. Deployment to Google Cloud (from `DEPLOYMENT.md`)

The `DEPLOYMENT.md` file contains a very detailed guide for deploying the application to a production environment on Google Cloud Platform. This is a great next step if you want to get the application running in a production-like setting.
